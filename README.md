# platform-commons

This project was generated with Angular CLI version 12+.

## Problem Statement

Create an Angular project with routing included. The project will have two routes: Catalogue page and Cart/Basket page. The main functionalities and requirements are as follows:

- Create a JSON file containing an array of products with fields like Name, Image, Weight, and Price.
- Implement the Catalogue page to display products fetched from the JSON file. Each product should have an "Add to cart" button.
- Implement a Cart page to display the added products, their quantities, and provide options to increase, decrease, or remove items.
- Show a cart icon in the catalogue page for easy navigation to the cart page.
- Ensure the UI is responsive.

### Bonus Features

- Implement a remove button in the cart page to remove products from the added products list.
- Implement a checkout/confirm order button that redirects the user to a summary page with the order details.
